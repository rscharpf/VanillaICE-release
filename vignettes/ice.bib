	This algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information, including
	total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratio at each SNP marker,
	the distance between neighboring SNPs, the allele frequency of SNPs,
	and the pedigree information where available. We applied PennCNV
	to genotyping data generated for 112 HapMap individuals; on average,
	we detected approximately 27 CNVs for each individual with a median
	size of approximately 12 kb. Excluding common rearrangements in lymphoblastoid
	cell lines, the fraction of CNVs in offspring not detected in parents
	(CNV-NDPs) was 3.3\%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of

  abstract = {Array-based technologies have been used to detect chromosomal copy
	number changes (aneuploidies) in the human genome. Recent studies
	identified numerous copy number variants (CNV) and some are common
	polymorphisms that may contribute to disease susceptibility. We developed,
	and experimentally validated, a novel computational framework (QuantiSNP)
	for detecting regions of copy number variation from BeadArray SNP
	genotyping data using an Objective Bayes Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM).
	Objective Bayes measures are used to set certain hyperparameters
	in the priors using a novel re-sampling framework to calibrate the
	model to a fixed Type I (false positive) error rate. Other parameters
	are set via maximum marginal likelihood to prior training data of
	known structure. QuantiSNP provides probabilistic quantification
	of state classifications and significantly improves the accuracy
	of segmental aneuploidy identification and mapping, relative to existing
	analytical tools (Beadstudio, Illumina), as demonstrated by validation
	of breakpoint boundaries. QuantiSNP identified both novel and validated
	CNVs. QuantiSNP was developed using BeadArray SNP data but it can
	be adapted to other platforms and we believe that the OB-HMM framework
	has widespread applicability in genomic research. In conclusion,
	QuantiSNP is a novel algorithm for high-resolution CNV/aneuploidy
	detection with application to clinical genetics, cancer and disease
	association studies.},

	propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level,

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In studies of case-parent trios, we define copy
	number variants (CNVs) in the offspring that differfrom the parental
	copy numbers as de novo and of interest for their potential functional
	role indisease. Among the leading array-based methods for discovery
	of de novo CNVs in case-parent triosis the joint hidden Markov model
	(HMM) implemented in the PennCNV software. However, thecomputational
	demands of the joint HMM are substantial and the extent to which
	false positiveidentifications occur in case-parent trios has not
	been well described. We evaluate these issues in astudy of oral cleft
	case-parent trios. RESULTS: Our analysis of the oral cleft trios
	reveals that genomic waves represent a substantial source of falsepositive
	identifications in the joint HMM, despite a wave-correction implementation
	in PennCNV. Inaddition, the noise of low-level summaries of relative
	copy number (log R ratios) is stronglyassociated with batch and correlated
	with the frequency of de novo CNV calls. Exploiting the triodesign,
	we propose a univariate statistic for relative copy number referred
	to as the minimum distancethat can reduce technical variation from
	probe effects and genomic waves. We use circular binarysegmentation
	to segment the minimum distance and maximum a posteriori estimation
	to infer denovo CNVs from the segmented genome. Compared to PennCNV
	on simulated data,MinimumDistance identifies fewer false positives
	on average and is comparable to PennCNV withrespect to false negatives.
	Genomic waves contribute to discordance of PennCNV andMinimumDistance
	for high coverage de novo calls, while highly concordant calls on
	chromosome 22were validated by quantitative PCR. Computationally,
	MinimumDistance provides a nearly 8-foldincrease in speed relative
	to the joint HMM in a study of oral cleft trios. CONCLUSIONS: Our
	results indicate that batch effects and genomic waves are important
	considerations forcase-parent studies of de novo CNV, and that the
	minimum distance is an effective statistic forreducing technical
	variation contributing to false de novo discoveries. Coupled with
	segmentationand maximum a posteriori estimation, our algorithm compares
	favorably to the joint HMM withMinimumDistance being much faster.},
